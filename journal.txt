Creating this Journal to help show that I am actively learning, as well as to keep my focus. I had become a bit too distracted trading stocks the last few months,
and am hoping that this journal will get me back on track. It will include information about what I have been working on, and maybe also some notes. 
Let's do this!!!

Entry: Continued to read Web Security for Developers by Malcolm McDonald. Finished up Chapter 6 - Injection Attacks. The chapter contained some good info on mitigating
SQL injection by using bind parameters/parameterized statements and also object-relational mapping. It also touched on command injection attacks, remote code execution,
and file upload attacks. Started Chapter 7 - Cross-Site Scripting Attacks.
